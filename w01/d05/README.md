#RESPONSIVE THEMES

**Pair Programming Exercise**

There's both good news and bad news. The good news is that we found the perfect responsive theme, the bad news is that with all the money we spent on sweets last week we don't have enough to purchase it now.

In today's lab we're going to take an existing responsive theme and attempt to recreate it using our knowledge of HTML and CSS.

Here's the theme we're going to recreate today:

##THE DEETS

###PREPARE
- Review your notes on HTML, CSS, responsive design, grids, and CSS frameworks.
 
###REQUIREMENTS
- At a minimum, the design should support a full desktop and mobile screen size. For our purposes today, let's say 736px and below is considered mobile.
- Don't worry about using any of the existing text or images on the theme for this lab. You can, but feel free to use your own images or placeholders even.

###OPTIONAL
- Use a CSS framework like Bootstrap.

###INSTRUCTIONS

**Step One - Study the existing layout and talk through what's happening as the viewport changes**
- Use your desk or any of the whiteboards in the room to plan out how you'll proceed

**Step Two - Write the HTML**
- Remember to use semantic markup where you can!
- Remember that you don't have to create an exact copy of the theme, but try to get as close to it as you can
- Link your CSS in an external stylesheet

**Step Three - Write the CSS**
- Remember to include a ``` normalize.css ``` file to create a consistent starting point across all the different browsers
- Remember the `float`, `display` and `clear` properties that will help you with your layout
- Add some styles! Make it yours

####BONUS
- Build support for tablet devices as well. Do some research to find out the appropriate screen sizes to consider for this new medium.
