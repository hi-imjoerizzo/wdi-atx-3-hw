## Warm Up Brain Teaser

There are 100 closed lockers in a hall, and 100 students. Student 1 
walks down the hall and opens all 100 lockers. Student 2 closes all 
even-numbered lockers. Student 3 looks at every third locker (a 
multiple of 3), and if it is open closes it, or vice-versa (this 
student changes the condition of the locker). Student 4 repeats the 
action of student 3, but only changes the condition of lockers that 
are a multiple of 4. This goes on with every student doing the same 
routine for his or her number.

After 100 students go through, how many lockers are open?
