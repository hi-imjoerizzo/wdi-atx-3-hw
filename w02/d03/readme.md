## Deck o' Cards

Time for a gameâ€¦ but first we'll need a deck of playing cards. Use `deck_o_cards.js` as a starting point for this exercise.

1. Make the function `deck_o_cards` assemble an array of cards using the provided *suits* and *values* arrays. Each card in the deck should be an object formatted as:
  * `{suit: 'hearts', value: 'A'}`
2. Make `deck_o_cards` return a shuffled array of cards.
3. Call `deck_o_cards`, then print the following:
  * **"The deck has {n} cards"**
  * **"The top card is the {value} of {suit}"**

## Bonus

1. Make a new array that pulls the top 5 cards and gives you a hand of poker!!
